I love creating software in a team since I'm a young teenager! My favorite part of the work is to create tools and programs that are helping people to do their work â€“ customers or team members, doesn't matter! In the last years I lead smaller software teams by example.

Currently, I'm working at **i22** a digital agency focused on software development from design to deployment. My main tasks include maintaining a product database in Elixir for a medium-sized ecommerce system and transforming the software stack from a legacy based mixed language ecosystem to a more modern container based ecosystem.

It was always important to me to understand every part of the software stack and while I'm most comfortable in the **architecture** and **backend** part I'm able to work **full stack**. My main languages are at the moment **Elixir**, **Rust** and **NodeJs**. I'm able to develop software in other languages and various frameworks, take a look at my project and working history!

In my spare time I'm playing *computer games*, toying around with *3D printing* and playing *board / table-top games* with friends. If you have a place in a *Pathfinder 2E* or *Call of Cthulhu* group, write me!

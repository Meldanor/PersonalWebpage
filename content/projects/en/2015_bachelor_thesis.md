_Latency reduction for interactive data visualization of simulation data in astronomy_

I tried to find tools and ways to provide an interactive data visualization for a collogue from my Fraunhofer team. I provided him multiple tools and we wrapped a bachelor thesis around. It was fun, but I don't this this is a good bachelor thesis in the end.

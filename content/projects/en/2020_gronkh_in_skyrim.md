An automatic analysis of Gronkhs inventory weight and gold development over his playtime in his brilliant [Skyrim Let's Play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFFZI8n-aVU). One part was the data mining process with tessaract and OCR and calculating the values with Java. The second part was the website in Vue. Very fun!

In [Gronkhs Let's Play](https://gronkh.tv/streams/496) of the game [Mad Games Tycoon 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1342330/Mad_Games_Tycoon_2/) he created (for me) very funny game titles and description and I wanted a place in the internet to archive them. The website was my first interaction with tailwind and first "complex" HTML/CSS.
